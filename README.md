# StoreManagmentSystem
Vehicules Store management in java json and mongo db


This Java project focuses on implementing Object-Oriented principles while exploring JSON files and MongoDB. It involves creating a "Store Management System" enabling users to add, retrieve, update, and search for items within categories. The system operates via the command line, offering options to interact and manipulate data loaded from JSON or MongoDB sources.

Key functionalities include adding/updating items, searching for exact/close matches, and removing items, with sorting based on defined criteria. Users are prompted to save changes before exiting (limited JSON/MongoDB access: read on launch, write on close).

The project's main requirements include using Java interfaces/abstract classes to handle JSON/MongoDB interactions and item categories, implementing input validation/error handling, and utilizing Java Streams for closest match search and result sorting.
